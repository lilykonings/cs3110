type connection

(* init addr retries attempts to initalize a connection with addr, retrying at
 * most retries times.  If initialization succeeds, all subsequent outputs
 * using this connection will be retried up to retries times.
 * Returns: Some(c) where c is the successfully initialized connection to addr
 *          None if initialization failed *)
val init : Unix.sockaddr -> int -> connection option

(* input conn blocks until a value is present on conn, or the connection closes
 * Returns: Some(v) if the read on conn succeeded, where v is the value present
 *          on conn.
 *          None otherwise *)
val input : connection -> 'a option

(* output conn value sends value through conn, retrying up to retries times.
 * Returns: whether the output succeeded. *)
val output : connection -> 'a -> bool

(* output-string conn value sends value through conn, retrying up to retries times.
 * Returns: whether the output succeeded. *)
val output_string : connection -> string -> bool

(* close conn closes conn and all associated file descriptors *)
val close : connection -> unit

(* address conn returns the address for the connection. *)
val address : connection -> Unix.sockaddr

(* Students: don't call this.
 *
 * Generates a connection object based on an already opened socket. *)
val server : Unix.sockaddr -> Unix.file_descr -> connection
